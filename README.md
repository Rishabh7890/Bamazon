If MyTerminalStore has the product left in stock your total will be displayed and the user will be asked if they would like to buy another item or exit the application fot now.

In the case the user wants to buy another item the updated list of products will appear and the user will again be asked the series of questions.

If MyTerminalStore does not have enough of the product in stock the user will be alerted and asked whether they would like to take another look at the inventory and purchase another quantity or item, or exit the application.
